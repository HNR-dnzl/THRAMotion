        There are other types of Motion, such asâ€¦

        <b>Uniform Motion</b> and <b>Non-Uniform Motion</b>. A body is said to be in a state of uniform motion when it covers an equal amount of distance in equal intervals of time. In such cases, if we represent the motion on the graph, it would be a straight line.

    <a class="uniform2">
        <b>Uniform Motion</b>is defined as the motion of an object in which the object travels in a straight line, and its velocity remains constant along that line as it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, irrespective of the duration of the time. 
    </a>

    <img src="motiongraph2.png" class="motiongraph2">

    <a class="nonmotion">
        Non-uniform Motion can be defined as when a given body is covering unequal distances in a set and given intervals of time. If you will represent the path of a body moving in non-uniform motion on a graph, it will be a curved line. This type of motion is defined as the motion of an object in which the object travels with varied speed and it does not cover the same distance in equal time intervals, irrespective of the time interval duration.
