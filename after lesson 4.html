        <b><i>Newtons Laws of Motion</i></b> laid the foundation for classical mechanics today. Although subject to minor limitations, these laws of motion are valid everywhere and are therefore used.<br>
        <b><i>Law of Motion:</i></b> “A body acted on by no net force moves with constant velocity (which may be zero) and zero acceleration.” <br>

        Also known as the Law of Inertia, it refers to the tendency of a body to keep moving once it is set in motion results from a property. The tendency of a body at rest to remain at rest is also due to inertia. t’s important to note that the net force is what matters in Newton’s first law. For example, a physics book at rest on a horizontal tabletop has two forces acting on it: an upward supporting force, or normal force, exerted by the tabletop and the downward force of the earth’s gravitational attraction (a long-range force that acts even if the tabletop is elevated above the ground). The upward push of the surface is just as great as the downward pull of gravity, so the net force acting on the book (that is, the vector sum of the two forces) is zero. In agreement with Newton’s first law, if the book is at rest on the tabletop, it remains at rest. The same principle applies to a hockey puck sliding on a horizontal, frictionless surface: The vector sum of the upward push of the surface and the downward pull of gravity is zero. Once the puck is in motion, it continues to move with constant velocity because the net force acting on it is zero.
