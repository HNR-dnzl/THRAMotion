        Force
    </h1>

    <a class="lessondes">
        <b>Force</b> is a push or a pull to put it simply. A better definition is that a force is an interaction between two bodies or between a body and its environment. 
        That is why we always refer to the force that one body exerts on a second body. When you push on a car that is stuck in the snow, you exert a force on the car; a steel cable exerts a force on the beam it is hoisting at a construction site; and so on.
        Force is a vector quantity; you can push or pull a body in different directions. The push or pull on an object can vary in either magnitude or direction. For example, a cannon exerts strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in Vectors. Force is a vector quantity; you can push or pull a body in different directions.
